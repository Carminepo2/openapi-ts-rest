A simple tool to generate a [ts-rest](https://github.com/ts-rest/ts-rest) contract (with zod validation) from an OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 specification.

## Installation üì¶

You can use `openapi-ts-rest` in two ways: as a CLI tool or as a core library within your code.

### CLI Installation

```sh
pnpm add @openapi-ts-rest/cli
```

### Core Library Installation

```sh
pnpm add @openapi-ts-rest/core
```

## Usage üöÄ

### CLI Usage

```sh
# If installed globally
openapi-ts-rest path/to/openapi-spec.yaml -o path/to/output/dir
# If installed in a project
npx openapi-ts-rest path/to/openapi-spec.yaml -o path/to/output/dir
```

- `-o`, `--output`: Directory where the generated TypeScript files will be saved.

### Core Library Usage

If you prefer to integrate the functionality directly into your code, you can do so with the core library:

```typescript
import { generateContract, GenerateContractOptions } from "@openapi-ts-rest/core";
import fs from "fs";

const result = await generateContract({ openApi: "path/to/openapi-spec.yaml" });
fs.writeFileSync("path/to/output/dir", result);
```

## Features ‚ú®

- **OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 Support**: Full support for the latest OpenAPI specifications.
- **Flexible Usage**: Use the CLI for quick operations or the core library for deeper integration.
- **Zod Schema Generation**: Automatically generate Zod schemas for runtime validation.
